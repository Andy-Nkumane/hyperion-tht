# Python Task

## Code Review

* line 1 - the solution doesn't have to be in a class, a function will suffice
* line 2 - indent is misaligned
* line 2 - stick to python's funcion naming convention which is snake_case and lowercase
* line 2 - it is good practice to write out words in full
* line 3 - isn't named accurately, since result will contain multiple values, it should be in the plural form: `results`
* line 5 - sorted is missing an argument to sort
* line 5 - it is not good practice to have a one letter variable, rather have an explicit variable name that won't cuase confusion as the code progresses - the same applies for the iterator on line 4
